### Project Overview

- This project focuses on enhancing images captured in night-time and adverse weather conditions to improve object detection performance. The approach involves image enhancement techniques such as dehazing, denoising, and contrast adjustment, followed by object detection using deep learning models.

### Features

- Preprocessing of images to remove noise, haze, and improve contrast.
- Application of deep learning models for object detection.
- Evaluation of enhancement techniques on detection accuracy.
- Support for various datasets with night and adverse weather conditions.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

##### Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+

#### Steps

##### Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/suraj-sharma3/Enhancing-Night-And-Adverse-Weather-Images-For-Object-Detection.git

### Usage

- Prepare the dataset by placing images in the data/ directory.

- Run the preprocessing script: 

- Run the object detection model:

- Evaluate the performance: 

### Dataset

This project can be used with custom datasets with low-visibility conditions

### Results

Results will be stored in the output/ directory, including enhanced images, detection outputs, and evaluation metrics.
